# Resolve Getline Conflict



I was attempting to build CVS ( Concurrent Versions System ), an old revision control system, that was written back in the 90s. 

It's largely been replaced. Today, most know git, the most popular version control system, but unlike git, CVS uses a client-server architecture rather than the distrubted architecture that git applies. Due to this fact, a far more analygous version control system to CVS is Subversion; both of which implement the client-server architecture.


That said, the distinction between CVS and Subversion vs git, is rather interesting; being somewhat of a microcosm of the perpetually dualing principles of simplicity vs functionality. It's important to note, while, if inattentive, this two ideals can quickly descend into rivals, they are NOT mutually exclusive, but I digress.

Returning to CVS vs git, or more generally, client-server vs distributed architectures in version control systems, From an inexperienced onlooker, git appears to be the obvious choice. It is rather significantly the most pervasive of the mentioned systems. This is nowhere more true than for beginners, as sites like GitHub and GitLab, inextricably tied to git, serve as beakon of light beckoning newcomers to their omnipresence, and; thus, the world of git.

Aside from the marketing prowress, the distrubted system upon which git is built lends itself to a vast array of functionality that is difficult or outright impossible in CVS. 


That functionality comes at a cost. It's very complicated. Both SVN and CVS are incredibly simple to learn and use compared to git.
