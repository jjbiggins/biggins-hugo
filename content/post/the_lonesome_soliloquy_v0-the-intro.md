Welcome, to the inagural iteration of ***The Lonesome Soliloquy Series***. For many, and, I surmise for all initially, me included, will find the topics, notions, ideas, opinions--whatever adjective one may choose--far too incongruent to justify them belonging to a singular literary entity, a Series, for lack of a better word. And, from this perspective, I cannot disagree. 


This is not a series of a subject matter; this is a series of thought, of thinking. That thinking is so unique to the human race, the kind each of us has experience,the kind of thought where one finds themselves rolling over in bed to check the clock to find out it's 4am on a Tuesday, or when only the rising sone could break one's  concentration. An explorer sailing the ship of their mind, with the strong wind of curiousity at their sails.

That said, speaking frankly, this series is for myself, hence the title. As such, for myself, there will never be an attempt to in anyway taylor my writing, thinking, subject matter, or anything in order to garner the attention of an audience. 

And, if a curious internet nomad is to stumble across this, and they were to take a brief moments of joy, feel companionship in ideas shared, or, even better, selfishly, disagree, and share an insight that had not encountered me, and I could learn further from. That's all the better.


In closing, the freqeuncy of publishing will be sporadic as the topics explored. After all, in the absence of catering to an audience to drive publication, an individual has only somemany thoughts worth writing about. 

A few things I can ensure, anything written will come from the  uncertain for the the uncertain. Those that find joy in learning, thought, and productive disagreement, when applicable, many writings will be of mathematical, scientific, HOWTOs, or otherwise irrefutable facts. Those which are not rooted in fact, will be my humble offering to a given topice intellectual exploration. Being an offer, it is readily, encouraged, to be rejected, so that I may revise, and learn myself. 


I know enough, to know I don't know anything.


Hope someone enjoys. Thanks.
