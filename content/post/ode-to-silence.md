# Ode To Silence
---

>*Throughout the land, all was quiet, silence, was all to see.*
>
>*The world held still; was this all there is to be?*
>
>*There was no war, and no epidemic plagued her people*
>
>*But the music had died; even the church bells of the steeple*

<br>


>*What was this demon, who had robbed the world of joy?*
>
>*Surely, a very cunning, evil thing could devise such a ploy*
>
>*But, instead, in the heart lied this oppressor*
>
>*Invisible, and unseen; it was no aggressor*


<br>


>*It stole hopes and dreams*
>
>*But what evil could act with such despicable means?*
>
>*The saddest shackles that indenture human-kind*
>
>*is emptiness, an empty heart and closed mind*

-- Joe biggins
