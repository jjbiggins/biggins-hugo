Thank You Layne,



Everyday, every single day, I get up and try to stop thinking about you. I've always been quite verbose, and you been, well, the contrary. 

I love you for that. I always have. At this particular time, though, it's made it difficult, but that's not important. Not now.


I'm here to write to you, my love. I understand the situation at hand. I do. 

I know you'll never see this, so let me be the verbose guy one last time.




Anyway, thank you.


I remeber telling you; I believe in the Hilton, of which I said, during Lolla, I was a hard person to date.

That was mid-July maybe early-August. 

I asked you out on July 4th that same month. 

In the ensuing next 5 years, I carried you, you carried me, both methaphorically and physically. 

I'm aware I was the end of our relationship. I became colder than ever; distance was my signature. I simply wasn't there. I was a boyfriend only in title. 

That's a burden I'll always bear.

You did the right thing. Moving on. It's what I would've wanted you to do. 


But after after proving you have the strength to deal with me for 5 years, I owe you at least this, or maybe I owe myself it.


So, here we go. 


Thank you, Layne. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for letting me into you heart. Thank you for inviting me to you families lake house. Thank you for letting me get to know them all. Thank you for taking a chance on someone after I told you I was no good to date. Thank you for loving a flawed man. Thank you for being the only person I've ever met who silenced my mind, and I could live, for a brief moment at peace. Thank you for being the best part of my life for 5 years. Thank you for being there for me when I hurt. Thank you for everything.


I will always love you. 


Love, Joe
