# Dear Layne,



Do people run out of tears? We have too, right? I hope we do.


I once told you I the movie ***A Star is Born*** reminded me of us, a long time ago. Maybe 3, 4 years. Lone time.

Either way, that's not the point.

It did remind me of us. Life was so hard back then, so incredibly hard. Since, it's been less hard, but hard. Anyway, In the last two years, maybe more, I've never watched that movied. Not a single time. 

Now, not weird, but I own that movie. 

Its one of the 6 movies I've purchased in my life life. Hell, I watch each of those oftenl hell, I watched ***13 Days*** twice this week, haha.


Anway, this is my point:

I didn't watch tha movie cause I was scared. So, scared. Was I scared cause I couldn't bet my heary on you anymore? Was I scared cause I was Jack? Maybe both. Who knows, god knows I never did. 

Was I afraid of loosing you?

These are all faor questions, 


I watched it tonight.


It's like getting a call from the boss of crying, and he said I had another shift.

repeated; One, ***13 Days*** I watched twice this week, but never ***A Star is Born***
